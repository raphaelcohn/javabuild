 .
 The answers given in this FAQ list are provided with the best intentions, but they may not be accurate for any particular shell/os. They may be completely wrong for any shell/os. If you don't test the answers, that's a bug in your procedures.
 .
 There are no guarantees for the answers or recommendations given in this document. In fact, I don't even claim to have tested any or all of them myself. Many of the answers here have been contributed by one or more regular participants in the newsgroup, who I believe to be competent (certainly more competent than I am), but THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.
 .
 Did I really need to make that all uppercase? Hopefully not, but there are a lot of lawyers around with too much time on their hands, so I want to make it clear that THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES about the accuracy of answers in this FAQ list. This is, hopefully, an aid to people trying to learn shell programming, but it is NOT a supported product. You have to figure out for yourself whether or not the answers here work for what you're trying to do.
 .
 Under no circumstances will the maintainer of this FAQ list, or any contributors to it, be held liable for any mistakes in this document. If the answers work for you, well and good. If not, please tell me and I'll modify them appropriately so that this will be more useful.
 .
 If you don't agree to that, don't read any farther than this. Reading beyond this point indicates your agreement.
 .
 If you do test the answers and find a problem, please send email to the maintainer (see above), so it can be corrected, or (preferably) post a question to the newsgroup so it can be discussed and corrected if there's a problem.
 .
 A number of people have contributed to this FAQ, knowingly or unknowingly. Some of the answers were taken from previous postings in the group, and other people contributed questions and answers directly to the maintainer, which you are welcome to do as well.
 .
 Among the contributors is Heiner Steven, who also provided the momentum to get this FAQ list started. He maintains a web site about shell programming that has a lot of good stuff in it: http://www.shelldorado.com/
